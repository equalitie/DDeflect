DDeflect User Documentation
========

This directory contains some guides on how DDeflect works and how to particpate by setting up your own V-edges.

* `Vedge.apache.README.md` shows how to use Apache as a V-edge service. If you don't have strong preferences as regards webserver, you aren't running a web server already or if you're already running Apache, this guide is the way to go.
* `Vedge.trafficserver.README.md` explains how to use [Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/) as a V-edge.
* `Vedge.generic.README.md` details how to set up a generic V-edge independent of webserver type.
